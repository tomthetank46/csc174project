# In-Class Assignment 6

## Colors:
	Colors were editied to a dark background with gray body text, orange titles and lavender accents. This would allow the text to contrast with the background, and the titles to contrast with the body and highlights.

## Layout:
	Each section has an introduction part on the left and a larger history section on the right. Titles are sandwiched between two lines and left alligned.

	Borders around body paragraphs were removed to allow for all text to be left alligned, alligning them with the titles and each other.

	Sections are also positioned close in proximity to each other.

## Typefaces:
	New typefaces were chosen for h1 and h2, and for the rest of the page. The h1 and h2s appear larger, so a unique Monterey font was chosen to stand out while maintaining readability. Lato was used for much of the body, as it's rounded edges make it appear neat and friendly while also making it readable in a large amount of text.

## Other:
	Intro and brief history sections were too close together without borders, so spacing was added.
