			<h3>American Eagle</h3>

				<div class = "grid">
					<div>

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., now known as simply American Eagle, is an American lifestyle clothing and accessories retailer, headquartered in the Southside Works Neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
				<h4>Brief History</h4>
					<p>American Eagle's beginning was with the Silverman family, which owned and operated Silvermans Menswear. By the mid-1970s, two of the Silverman brothers—from the third generation of Silvermans in the family business—were running the family business. Jerry Silverman was the president and CEO, while his brother, Mark Silverman, served as executive vice-president and COO. The Silverman brothers were convinced they needed to diversify their product offerings in order to continue growing their company. They also recognized that the addition of new family-owned chains would then enable them to operate more than one store in the same mall. American Eagle stores were set up in shopping malls and a catalog was established. The chain grew for much of the 1980s.</p>
